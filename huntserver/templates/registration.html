    <p>
      In our continuing efforts to bring you the best possible puzzlehunt experience,
      <b>the way registration works this semester is different</b> than last semester.
      From now on, each hunter will have <b>their own account</b>
      and <b>once logged in, simply join or make a team</b> to register for the hunt. 
      This has all sorts of cool added benefits such as 
      being able to keep a history of completed hunts,
      only having to enter your dietary preferences once (don't worry, you can update them),
      and college integration so you can sign on with your CMU account! (yet again, no worries, a cmu account is not required)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now head over to our <a href="{% url 'huntserver:login_selection' %}?next=/registration/">sign in page.</a> 
      Once you sign in you'll be redirected back here to join or make a team. 
    </p>
  {% else %}
  {% for team in teams %}
    In the future, you will be able to sign up for one of these fabulous teams (or make your own):
    <ul>
      <li>{{team.team_name}}</li>
    </ul>
  {% endfor %}
