    <h2>What are the puzzles like?</h2>
    <p>For examples of the kinds of puzzles we'll give you, check out our <a href="{% url 'huntserver:previous_hunts' %}">Past Hunts</a></p>
    <p>Or these similar hunts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.collegepuzzlechallenge.com/">Microsoft College Puzzle Challenge</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/">The MIT Mystery Hunt</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sounds fun! How does my team win?</h2>
    <p>
      Each puzzle yields a solution (like a word or a phrase). You'll be combining answers to
      puzzles with a mechanic that will be explained more on the day of the hunt.
      Eventually players reach the endgame, a bonus round for those who
      complete the puzzles the fastest.
    </p>
    <h2>How do I register?</h2>
    <p>Register your team of five (or fewer if you want) <a href="{% url 'huntserver:registration' %}">here!</a>
    </p>

    <h2>What should I bring?</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>A team of no more than five people. Humans only, please. Robots are discouraged; they mess up the sensors.</li>
        <li>Laptops. All of our puzzles will be online. </li>
    <li>Scissors. These will be helpful. </li> 
        
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>How long will it last?</h2>
    <p>The hunt is expected to run 8 hours. If there isn't a winner by 8 hours in (rare), we'll inform all teams to keep playing and continue until there's a winner.</p>

    <h2>Will there be food?</h2>
    <p>
       Yes, there will be food, usually pizza. If you have dietary restrictions, please list them in the appropriate box when registering. 
    </p>

    <h2>Is there anything else I should know?</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>There may be some running around campus required.</li>
        <li>You CAN register a partial team and we'll do our best to try to match all of the partial teams on the day of.</li>
        <li>Nothing on this and the registration page is a puzzle crucial for completing the hunt. No, really, this is not a puzzle.</li>
    </ul>
