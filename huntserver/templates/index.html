    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>
      We are PuzzlehuntCMU, a group of puzzle enthusiasts from Carnegie Mellon University. We work together to solve Puzzle Hunts such as the <a href="http://www.mit.edu/puzzle/">MIT mystery hunt</a>, or any of the many tech company puzzlehunts (examples of such companies include Microsoft, APT and Palantir). We also write and host CMU's very own Puzzlehunt once a semester, with the goal of providing a fun-filled experience to as many members of the community as possible.
    </p>
    <h2>What is a Puzzlehunt?</h2>
    <p>
      Very simply put, it's a full-day event where people get together to solve carefully designed puzzles which somehow link together on a larger scale.
      <br>
      A puzzlehunt is typically characterized by its structure. In addition to several normal puzzles, each round has a meta-puzzle, which requires teams to have solved most of the normal puzzles to even unlock, and often requires solvers to incorporate answers from that round's normal puzzles to make sense of.
      <br>
      Our puzzlehunt's structure changes from semester to semester so as to provide new challenges for solvers.
    </p>
