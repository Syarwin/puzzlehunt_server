    <h2>What is a Puzzlehunt?</h2>
    <p>
      Very simply put, it's an event where people get together to solve carefully designed puzzles which often somehow link together on a larger scale.
      <br>
      A puzzlehunt is typically characterized by its structure. In addition to several normal puzzles, each round has a meta-puzzle, which requires teams to have solved most of the normal puzzles to even unlock, and often requires solvers to incorporate answers from that round's normal puzzles to make sense of.
      <br>
      Our puzzlehunt's structure changes from semester to semester so as to provide new challenges for solvers.
