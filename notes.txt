Production server start:

ensure nginx is up
ensure mysql is up
ensure redis is up

python manage.py collectstatic

(I don't know how to properly kill this, maybe use two separate tmux sessions)
uwsgi --ini wdjango.ini& uwsgi --ini wweb.ini&

Where I got nginx setup from: http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html

Known issues: (listed here so they don't become unknown)
 - Chat needs to be inline block (dynamic sizing reasons)
  - Text in chat box should wrap
Large scale issues: 
 - Code is horribly uncommented (Puzzle.py, Redis.py, Views.py, Templates)
 - We are horribly vulnerable to XSS
 - HTML has inbody script :(
