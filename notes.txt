Where I got nginx setup from: http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html

Where I got development setup from: http://django-websocket-redis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/running.html#django-with-websockets-for-redis-behind-nginx-using-uwsgi

List of planned websockets:
- puzzle_submissions -> self, admin
- home_page_update -> self

Known issues: (listed here so they don't become unknown)
 - Websockets sends UTC solve time to progress page
 - Any user can access staff page and unlock/reset puzzles
 - Access to puzzles isn't limited by team.unlocked
 - Code is horribly uncommented
 - HTML has inbody script :(
 - Admin pages don't have logout button
 - There is no error page for not being allowed somewhere.
