Production server start:

ensure nginx is up
ensure mysql is up
ensure redis is up

python manage.py collectstatic

(I don't know how to properly kill this, maybe use two separate tmux sessions)
uwsgi --ini wdjango.ini& uwsgi --ini wweb.ini&

Where I got nginx setup from: http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html
