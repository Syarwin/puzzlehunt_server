# puzzlehunt_server
Server for Puzzlehunt CMU's bi-annual puzzlehunt. Includes basic features such as per-puzzle pages, automatic answer response, teams, customizable unlocking structure, and admin pages to manange submissions, teams, as well as hunt progress. It also includes automatic team creation from registration, privacy settings for hunts, cool charts, a built in chat, and automatic file fetching and hosting. 

Documentation can be found at http://docs.puzzlehunt.club

While there is fairly large amount of configuration making this specific to Puzzlehunt CMU, if you are interested in getting this running elsewhere, let me know. I'd be happy to help anyone who wants to get this up and running for their needs.
